# Thesis

IPCC Database Project

## Deployment Notes

Cannot deploy to Vercel due to serverless functions not supporting sockets.

Can probably deploy to Heroku. Might need to set up a custom server for that.

## Alternative to Sockets.io

https://boardgame.io/ - Turn based so not ideal

https://peerjs.com/ - Would need to manage multiple peer to peer connections

https://liveblocks.io - Requires account

# Testing

Testing next js https://nextjs.org/docs/testing#cypress

Example using socket io for testing: https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/test-socketio-chat-using-cypress/
