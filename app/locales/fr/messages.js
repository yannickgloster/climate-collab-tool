There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.\",\"Trend Line\":\"Trend Line\",\"Try load it again.\":\"Try load it again.\",\"Unassigned Region\":\"Unassigned Region\",\"United States of America\":\"United States of America\",\"View Interactive Atlas\":\"View Interactive Atlas\",\"View the World\":\"View the World\",\"You aren't in a lobby.\":\"You aren't in a lobby.\",\"You cannot afford this option\":\"You cannot afford this option\",\"You're looking a little lost.\":\"You're looking a little lost.\",\"Your Region\":\"Your Region\",\"button.joinSimulation\":\"Rejoindre une Simulation\",\"button.newSimulation\":\"Nouvelle Simulation\",\"footer\":\"Créé par Yannick <0>Yannick Gloster</0> | <1>Sources</1>\",\"image.credit.1\":\"Photo by <0>Katerina Kerdi</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.10\":\"Photo by <0>Qang Jaka</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.11\":\"Photo by <0>Luca Bravo</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.12\":\"Photo by <0>Ant Rozetsky</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.13\":\"Photo by <0>Joël de Vriend</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.14\":\"Photo by <0>Breno Assis</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.15\":\"Photo by <0>Rob Menting</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.16\":\"Photo by <0>American Public Power Association</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.17\":\"Photo by <0>Frank Eiffert</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.18\":\"Photo by <0>Luke Besley</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.19\":\"Photo by <0>VOO QQQ</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.2\":\"Photo by <0>eberhard 🖐 grossgasteiger</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.20\":\"Photo by <0>Arno Senoner</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.21\":\"Photo by <0>Collab Media</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.3\":\"Photo by <0>Marita Kavelashvili</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.4\":\"Photo by <0>Chris LeBoutillier</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.5\":\"Photo by <0>Anne Nygård</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.6\":\"Photo by <0>Stijn te Strake</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.7\":\"Photo by <0>Chris Ensminger</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.8\":\"Photo by <0>Annie Spratt</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"image.credit.9\":\"Photo by <0>Tim Mossholder</0> on <1>Unsplash</1>\",\"question.type.energyProduction\":\"Energy Production\",\"question.type.landUseChange\":\"Changing how we use our land\",\"region.button.leave\":\"Leave Simulation\",\"region.button.start\":\"Start Simulation\",\"region.description\":\"You've been automatically assigned a region.
